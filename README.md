# **BestBuy_BOT**

This is a very simple bot I'm working on that can be used
by anyone in order to purchase almost any high demand item they may want
from Best Buy. This is **NOT** associated with the BestBuy
cooperation in any way. This is still a work in progress and at the moment only 
notifies you if the item you are looking for is in stock or not and adds it to you cart.

## Project Checklist:
* ~~Add item to cart~~
* Continuosly check site for when the item is available
* Alert user when their desired item is available
* Automate the checkout process with the users input payment method
* Automatically log user into site for quicker checkout if they choose to do so
* Improve the overall efficiency of the bot and decrease the amount of time between refreshes
* Decrease the time needed to automate the process of checkout
